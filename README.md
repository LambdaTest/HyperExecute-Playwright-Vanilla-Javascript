HyperExecute is a smart test orchestration platform to run end-to-end Playwright tests at the fastest speed possible. HyperExecute lets you achieve an accelerated time to market by providing a test infrastructure that offers optimal speed, test orchestration, and detailed execution logs.

The overall experience helps teams test code and fix issues at a much faster pace. HyperExecute is configured using a YAML file. Instead of moving the Hub close to you, HyperExecute brings the test scripts close to the Hub!

# How to run SmartUI Playwright Sample automation tests on HyperExecute

* [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
   - [Download HyperExecute CLI](#download-hyperexecute-cli)
   - [Configure Environment Variables](#configure-environment-variables)

# Pre-requisites

Before using HyperExecute, you have to download HyperExecute CLI corresponding to the host OS. Along with it, you also need to export the environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

## Download HyperExecute CLI

HyperExecute CLI is the CLI for interacting and running the tests on the HyperExecute Grid. The CLI provides a host of other useful Tests that accelerate test execution. In order to trigger tests using the CLI, you need to download the HyperExecute CLI binary corresponding to the platform (or OS) from where the tests are triggered:

Also, it is recommended to download the binary in the project's parent directory. Shown below is the location from where you can download the HyperExecute CLI binary:

* Mac: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
* Linux: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
* Windows: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe

## Configure Environment Variables

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables LT_USERNAME & LT_ACCESS_KEY from the terminal. The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

For macOS:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

## About SmartUI Webhook

LambdaTest's SmartUI uses a webhook to call the `smartui.takeScreenshot` function. This function captures a screenshot of the full page and uses it for visual regression testing. The function is called using the `page.evaluate` method with the `lambdatest_action` parameter.

Here's an example of how to use the `smartui.takeScreenshot` function:

```javascript
await page.evaluate((_) => {},
    `lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify({ action: 'smartui.takeScreenshot', arguments: { fullPage: true, screenshotName: '<Your_Screenshot_Name>' }
    })}`)
```

Replace `<Your Screenshot Name>` with a relevant name for the screenshot. The screenshot will be saved with this name in the LambdaTest platform, and you can use it for comparing the UI changes over time.

## Test Execution

The CLI option *--config* is used for providing the custom HyperExecute YAML file (i.e. *yaml/win/.hyperexecute_matrix.yaml*). Run the following command on the terminal to trigger the tests in Test file Scenario on the HyperExecute grid.

```bash
./hyperexecute --config --verbose yaml/hyperexecute.yaml
```
